# i18n strings
# -----------------------
#
# IMPORTANT! GUIDE TO ADDING STRINGS:
# - Translations are organized into the following sections based on where the strings are used:
#    1. Globals: Never used in hbs templates. Only nested in route & component translations. Prefixed with "global".
#    2. Components: Strings consumed in components directory. Prefixed with directory path of component
#    3. Routes: Strings consumed in routes. Prefixed with directory path of route.
# - Use dasherized keys for readability.
#
# -----------------------
#
# Translations will serve two purposes:
# 1. Translating text (duh)
# 2. Modifying client specific string settings. Translations may be stored externally & fetched
# on a client by client case to modify a limited subset of verbiage through the app.
